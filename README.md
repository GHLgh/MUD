# MUD
The idea comes from one of the CS 241 assignment which is to build a chatroom server and client. After I finished the assignment, I thought "why don't I build a MUD out of it". And here I am.
* STORY
  * The first thought comes from Castlevania, players have to defeat dungeon master to escape from the "castle" (different classes have different purposes, but the goals are the same). Players will be randomly transport to rooms based on their status (levels, etc.) to produce some kind of difficulty control.
  * To be continued
* SCENE
  * It's a module that presents the infomation of the room where the player is at. The infomation includes the objects in the room and the actions player can perform.
* OBJECT
  * Module that player can interact with. Basically, it can be divided as creature and non-creature.
* ACTION
  * Module that shows the available actions that player can perform.
* SERVER
  * This directory contains modules that will be used when maintaining a server.
